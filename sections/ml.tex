% RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Introduction to what neural networks and more precisely recurrent neural networks and why they are ideal for solving this problem (remembering the order of inputs and time is linear which means all previous timesteps have an impact on the next)

\subsection{Long Short Term Memory}
Description of what exactly LSTM networks are
