Vessels navigating the Baltic Sea

Importance of maritime traffic globally and timely operation


\subsection{Automatic identification system}

Automatic identification system (\textit{AIS}) was introduced by the International Maritime Organization (\textit{IMO}) in the early 2000's in accordance with the Safety of Life at Sea (\textit{SOLAS}) treaty as an open communication tool for all maritime traffic. The main objectives of the treaty is to improve the safety of life at sea, protection of the marine environment and safety and efficiency of navigation \cite{IMO_2015}. In its general operating form, AIS operates on two VHF channels and all vessels or base stations within the vessels transmission range receive the messages transmitted and vice versa the vessel receives all messages broadcasted in its receiving range. The broadcasting is based on Self-organized Time Division Multiple Access (\textit{(S)TDMA}) with a minimum of 2000 time slots per minute broadcasting capacity rate and the ship-to-ship communication for closer vessels takes precedence over vessels farther away which allows for sharing time slots, and thus overloading the available time slots \cite{IMO_2015}.

The IMO requires in accordance with regulation V/19 of SOLAS, that all vessels with a gross tonnage of 300 or more on international voyages, cargo vessels of 500 gross tonnage or more not on international voyages and all passenger vessel disregarding the gross tonnage to be equipped with an AIS. Further, the EU requires new-built fishing vessels longer than 15 meters to be fitted with an AIS from November 2010 and existing vessels to install an AIS May 2014 at the latest \cite{EU_2011}. There are two types of AIS Class A and Class B. Class A transceiver are the more common and are compliant with the IMO regulations whereas Class B transceivers are not subject to the full IMO AIS requirements. Class B transceivers are typically simpler, of lower cost and installed on smaller vessels of one's own choosing for improving the situational awareness. Class A transceivers take precedence over Class B transceivers when broadcasting.

The vessels onboard sensors and positioning systems interface with the AIS to allow for communicating the status of the vessel, both static and dynamic information. AIS also allows for voyage related information and safety-related information to be transmitted via the system, see Table \ref{tab:ais-data}. The AIS guidelines requires that there is a minimum display and keyboard for input and receive of data, for updating information manually and retrieving data received via AIS.

The information received by the AIS does not provide the full situational picture of the vessels surroundings and should only be used as a navigational and situational awareness aid.

\caption{(A) Base station transmits information about other vessels, port data and possible hazards. Base station receives information from all vessels in range. (B) Ship-to-ship communication. Vessel broadcasts its current state (identifier, speed over ground, course over ground etc.) and receives data from all vessels in range, only limited by the number of possible time slots available. (C) Vessel outside range of transmitting AIS data to the base station still transmits information to other vessels.}

\end{figure}

The AIS integrated checks for data integrity, built-in integrity test (\textit{BIIT}), is not capable of validating data, for example a non-functional sensor will report as not available to the AIS.

The information available to transmit over AIS is divided into three groups static, dynamic and voyage-related.

\subsubsection{Estimated Time of Arrival}

Estimated time of arrival is the estimated time when a vessel will reach its destination, typically transmitted to the correct authorities 24 to 72 hours before arrival \cite{Veenstra_2021, EU_2009}. The means of communicating this ETA varies and the accuracy of the ETA is not guaranteed to be within any margin of error. Ports, being very complex infrastructures with many moving parts, has to operate with certain uncertainties of vessels arrival times and required demands and it is essential to plan port operations for a 24-hour period at a minimum \cite{Fancello_2011}. All uncertainties that can delay or alter any operations at port are therefore a risk.

\subsection{HELCOM dataset}

The HELCOM dataset covers the period from January 2009 to December 2019. Each month for each year is stored as its own comma separated value \textit{.csv} file.

The AIS data in the HELCOM dataset is already processed to some extent compared too raw AIS data, see example of raw AIS data in Section \textbf{ref to raw ais}.

Describe the features and quirks with the HELCOM dataset as it is a processed dataset that contains AIS data already processed from the raw format. Merging of A and B AIS message types

HELCOM dataset has no ETA entries meaning to use this dataset for ETA prediction the ATA is calculated for all points on the route until the vessel has arrived, the true arrival time. Can't compare vessels ETA with the estimation but knows the estimated time left

\subsubsection{Description of HELCOM dataset features}

The HELCOM dataset have twelve unique features for each entry described in Table \ref{tabl:HELCOM-features}. The features are static, dynamic and voyage-related AIS data merged from multiple sources.

\label{tabl:HELCOM-features}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Statistical information}

Unevenness of the recorded messages (time intervals distribution even) but large gaps in routes. Reasons can be merging of many databases, preprocessing of the data to unify the records. The number of "good" valid routes for training is much lower than the total number of routes. Some of that could be handled by generating routes (data) where there are gaps. In a realistic dataset with AIS data there are going to be faulty data and missing, so HELCOM data is quite accurate to real data without generating missing data.



Vessels physical features and the grouping of different vessels by size. In Figure \ref{fig:vessel-classes} an example of one year of unique vessels which have visited the port of Naantali can be seen.

\subsection{Port of Naantali}

The Port of Naantali is a rather important and busy port in the Baltic Sea. With a reported total of over 8 million tonnes of cargo passing through the port and over 1,000 port calls during 2020 its logistical importance is of significance \cite{PoN_2021}. 

This is also recognised in the HELCOM data by the amount of the data that has any connections to the Port of Naantali.

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}

\textbf{\% of data}                           & 8.21          & 7.16          & 7.30          & 13.19         & 12.30         & 12.30         & 12.30         & 10.17         & 10.87         & 10.61         \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Total amount of vessel data with connection to the Port of Naantali for each year of the HELCOM data.}
\label{tab:HELCOM-data-percent}
\end{table}

This data is the complete timeline for each vessel that has at any point during the years visited the Port of Naantali. Only a fraction of this data is actual viable data for the routes, described in \textbf{SECTION REFERENCE}.

The port is defined by manually defining a area that covers the whole operational area of the port, to include all berths and the possible routes to approach the port. Port of Naantali is for all vessels except small pleasure boats approachable from one direction, see Figure \ref{fig:FINLI-box}. This bounding box in red in Figure \ref{fig:FINLI-box} is what defines the area of when a vessel has entered the port.
